Revision history for JavaScript::ExtJS::V3

3.4.11 2014-06-01
    - Fixed sub redefined warning (changed use to require for Path::Class)
      (note that this is still the same version of ExtJS, which *is* actually
      v3.4.11, so the version number is still accurate and tied to ExtJS)

3.4.1 2013-06-25
    - Initial release
